# smart-emr-project 🥼🚑
SmartEMR 🏥🩺 is version1.0 of a comprehensive electronic health record system, along with inventory and collections management features, tailored for small to mid-sized clinics.

The application has features for storing patient information, doctor visit records, laboratory records and drug prescriptions.

Robust permission was also factored in for different cadre of staff. Admins have full access to the system while other staff can only visualize the workflows relevant to their departments.
